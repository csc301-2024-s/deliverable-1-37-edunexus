## Collaboration Standards
To keep on top of any Git Spaghetti that might happen, please stick to these Git Standards when working on your code. Remember if something gets tangled, it's up to the group to untangle it so sticking to these guidelines ensures that that happens as infrequently as possible!
- We will be developing using VS Code and PyCharm. Both can be used for all aspects of development and will be chosen based on personal preference. Compatability with both environments will be mantained.
### Commit Standards
- Begin each commit with a descriptive verb, e.g., `FIX`, `UPDATE`, `ADD`.
- Link commits to the relevant GitHub Issue.
### Branching
- Always branch from and merge back to `DEV` using Pull Requests.
- Dedicate a branch to each task.
- Attach Pull Requests to the corresponding GitHub Issue.
### Pull Requests
- Require two approvals for merging a PR to `DEV`.
- Use comments for feedback on specific lines in PRs.
### Issues and Tasks
- Issues will be tracked with [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/csc301-2024-s/deliverable-1-37-edunexus/issues)
- Tasks will be tracked with [GitHub Tasks]() *(pending setup)*

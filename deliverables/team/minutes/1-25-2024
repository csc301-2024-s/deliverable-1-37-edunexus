Meeting Notes:
- Worked together on completing the questions for Deliverable 1
    > Created pull requests for changes and had each other review and approve the pull requests
- Decided to work in an agile team environment
- Decided on our weekly meeting times
    > Decided on two 1 hr meetings per week. In the first meeting we would plan for the upcoming week, while in the second meeting we would review our work from the past week.
    > Decided on sending regular active working updates into our discord channel, e.g. if someone is working on a specific task they will message into the chat the task they are working on
- Decided on roles within the team
    > e.g. Decided who would be the leads for frontend, backend, database, etc.
- Clarified with everyone not to touch main and to do all work on branches
    > Decided that the only time that we would merge to main is right before the due date of each deliverable after discussing

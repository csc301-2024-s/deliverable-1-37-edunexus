## Product Details

#### Q1: What is the product?

EduNexus is an educational application designed to automate and personalize the report generation process for schools in underprivileged and crisis-stricken regions.

The problem EduNexus addresses is the significant challenge that educational institutions in crisis-stricken areas face: the lack of infrastructure for creating and managing student report forms. These schools struggle with high student-teacher ratios and manual, error-prone processes that hinder the provision of individualized attention and feedback to students.

Our project is in collaboration with middle schools, focused on educational advancement in these regions. By partnering with them, we aim to ensure that the application meets the real-world needs of its users.

We are planning to build a responsive web-based application that enables educators to efficiently generate detailed and motivational student report forms. A typical use case might involve a teacher who needs to quickly produce end-of-term reports for a large class, where the application would facilitate the creation of these reports in a standardized format, complete with personalized comments and visual performance analytics.

EduNexus focuses on what it can deliver to its users: a streamlined administrative process, accurate and informative report forms, and a tool that supports educators in their mission to provide quality education, despite the challenging circumstances they face.

#### Q2: Who are your target users?

EduNexus is a web-based application tailored to assist teachers in underprivileged and crisis-impacted regions with automated and personalized student report generation.

The core problem that EduNexus solves is the overwhelming difficulty faced by educators in these areas, who often deal with inadequate resources for report creation and high student-teacher ratios. This situation leads to a lack of personalized educational feedback for students, which is crucial for their academic development.

In partnership with non-profit organizations that help these schools on a daily basis dedicated to educational equity, EduNexus will provide a solution specifically designed to meet the needs of these challenging educational environments.

We are building a responsive web application that will enable teachers, such as Ms. Kokoro Simba, a grade 5 educator at a rural middle school with limited access to technology, to efficiently create comprehensive and motivational report forms for her students. For instance, after a semester of teaching a class of 150 students, Ms. Simba will use EduNexus to quickly generate individualized reports that not only reflect each student's performance but also provide constructive feedback and visual analytics of their progress.

By focusing on the user experience of educators like Ms. Simba, EduNexus aims to deliver a product that simplifies the administrative workload, promotes educational insight, and supports the mission of providing quality education under challenging circumstances.

#### Q5: Have you decided on how you will build it? Share what you know now or tell us the options you are considering.

For the EduNexus project, we have decided on a technology stack that balances robustness with ease of use, considering the constraints of our target environments.

**Technology Stack:**

- **Backend**: We will use Flask, a lightweight and flexible Python web framework, which is well-suited for our needs in rapid development and easy deployment.
- **PDF Generation**: ReportLab for creating PDF reports, offering extensive customization options for report layouts.
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib for generating charts and graphs, which will be used to visually represent student performance data.
- **Image Processing**: PIL (Python Imaging Library) for handling image files, which may be used in report customization.
- **Frontend**: For the frontend, we are considering React.js due to its component-based architecture, which will allow us to create a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL is our choice for the database to manage and store data securely and efficiently, given its strong reputation for reliability.
- **Deployment**: The application will be deployed on Heroku, which simplifies the deployment process and offers scalability. This is subject to change in the future.
- **Version Control**: Git will be used for version control, with GitHub as the central repository for code collaboration, management, and version control.

**Architecture:**

- The application will follow a **microservices architecture** pattern, with separate services for user management, report generation, and data visualization. This will allow us to scale parts of the system independently as demand grows.
- We will implement **RESTful APIs** for communication between the frontend and backend services, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and ease of integration.
- **Containerization** with Docker may be used to encapsulate our services, ensuring consistency across development, testing, and production environments.

**Third-Party Applications and APIs:**

- We are considering directly integrating **Matplotlib** into the service for rendering the academic progress visualizations on the frontend.
- For PDF generation, we will integrate **ReportLab** service to convert report data into downloadable document versions.
- If necessary, we will use **OAuth** for secure authentication, potentially integrating with Google or Microsoft accounts to streamline the login process for users.

**Deployment Strategy:**

- The deployment will be automated using **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines**, likely through GitHub Actions, which will automate testing and deployment processes. This will get clearer with time.

In the coming weeks, we will refine this technology stack and architecture, ensuring that it aligns with the needs of our users and the goals of our partner organizations.

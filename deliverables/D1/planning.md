## Product Details

#### Q1: What is the product?

EduNexus is an educational application designed to automate and personalize the report generation process for schools in underprivileged and crisis-stricken regions.

The problem EduNexus addresses is the significant challenge that educational institutions in crisis-stricken areas face: the lack of infrastructure for creating and managing student report forms. These schools struggle with high student-teacher ratios and manual, error-prone processes that hinder the provision of individualized attention and feedback to students.

Our project is in collaboration with middle schools, focused on educational advancement in these regions. By partnering with them, we aim to ensure that the application meets the real-world needs of its users.

We are planning to build a responsive web-based application that enables educators to efficiently generate detailed and motivational student report forms. A typical use case might involve a teacher who needs to quickly produce end-of-term reports for a large class, where the application would facilitate the creation of these reports in a standardized format, complete with personalized comments and visual performance analytics.

EduNexus focuses on what it can deliver to its users: a streamlined administrative process, accurate and informative report forms, and a tool that supports educators in their mission to provide quality education, despite the challenging circumstances they face.

#### Q2: Who are your target users?

EduNexus is a web-based application tailored to assist teachers in underprivileged and crisis-impacted regions with automated and personalized student report generation.

The core problem that EduNexus solves is the overwhelming difficulty faced by educators in these areas, who often deal with inadequate resources for report creation and high student-teacher ratios. This situation leads to a lack of personalized educational feedback for students, which is crucial for their academic development.

In partnership with non-profit organizations that help these schools on a daily basis dedicated to educational equity, EduNexus will provide a solution specifically designed to meet the needs of these challenging educational environments.

We are building a responsive web application that will enable teachers, such as Ms. Kokoro Simba, a grade 5 educator at a rural middle school with limited access to technology, to efficiently create comprehensive and motivational report forms for her students. For instance, after a semester of teaching a class of 150 students, Ms. Simba will use EduNexus to quickly generate individualized reports that not only reflect each student's performance but also provide constructive feedback and visual analytics of their progress.

By focusing on the user experience of educators like Ms. Simba, EduNexus aims to deliver a product that simplifies the administrative workload, promotes educational insight, and supports the mission of providing quality education under challenging circumstances.

#### Q5: Have you decided on how you will build it? Share what you know now or tell us the options you are considering.

For the EduNexus project, we have decided on a technology stack that balances robustness with ease of use, considering the constraints of our target environments.

**Technology Stack:**

Since one of the primary goals of our app is for it to be used in underprivileged areas, internet connectivity is not guaranteed. Therefore, we want to make the app run entirely locally and will be using [Electron](https://electronjs.org) to build the app. This approach allows the app to function locally without the need to internet connectivity.

- **Backend**: Node.js, a JavaScript runtime that seamlessly integrates with Electron allowing for a unified language and tech stack across frontend and backend. 
- **PDF Generation**: PDFKit, a PDF generation library for Node.js, which is well-suited for creating complex, multi-page, and interactive documents.
- **Data Visualization**: D3.js, a JavaScript library for producing dynamic, interactive data visualizations in the web browser. It's compatible with Electron and provides more flexibility and customization for web-based interfaces.
- **Image Processing**: Sharp, a high-performance Node.js module for resizing, converting, and manipulating images.
- **Frontend**: For the frontend, we are considering React.js due to its component-based architecture, which will allow us to create a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Database**: SQLite, a lightweight database that can be nicely bundled with an electron application and therefore does not require an external server.
- **Version Control**: Git will be used for version control, with GitHub as the central repository for code collaboration, management, and version control.

**Architecture:**

- The application will follow a **microservices architecture** pattern, with separate services for user management, report generation, and data visualization. This will allow us to scale parts of the system independently as demand grows.
- We will implement **RESTful APIs** for communication between the frontend and backend services, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and ease of integration.
- **Containerization** with Docker may be used to encapsulate our services, ensuring consistency across development, testing, and production environments.

**Third-Party Applications and APIs:**

- We are considering directly integrating **Matplotlib** into the service for rendering the academic progress visualizations on the frontend.
- For PDF generation, we will integrate **ReportLab** service to convert report data into downloadable document versions.
- If necessary, we will use **OAuth** for secure authentication, potentially integrating with Google or Microsoft accounts to streamline the login process for users.

**Deployment Strategy:**

- The deployment will be automated using **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines**, likely through GitHub Actions, which will automate testing and deployment processes. This will get clearer with time.

In the coming weeks, we will refine this technology stack and architecture, ensuring that it aligns with the needs of our users and the goals of our partner organizations.

## Teamwork Details

#### Q6: Have you met with your team?

In order to break the ice and get to know each other better, we decided to play a game of skribbl.io, an online drawing game. In this game, every round, one of the players draws a chosen word while others guess what the word is for points.

![Skribbl](https://github.com/csc301-2024-s/deliverable-1-37-edunexus/assets/34868792/6d779f73-2a47-491b-9955-fba3568f5a24)

#### Fun Facts:
* Arthur: has skied off a 12 ft cliff and his legs are still there! Additionally, of the 26 flights that he took last year, only 3 departed on time.
* Carson: compiles a list of his personal Academy Awards selections every year. While few would consider this fun, it is indisputably a fact.
* Jaffar: has been 3 different continents.

We have chosen Arthur as our Scrum Leader, who leads development cycles in our Agile working environment. This involves bi-weekly meetings to plan for the upcoming sprint and reflect upon progress. All team members were chosen for their role based on prior experience, making it easier for everyone to adapt to their responsibilities. We do not expect anyone to be an expert in their field, as we are all students. The goal is for everyone to pick up knowledge on their assigned specialties throughout the project and become more proficient by the end. Members are expected to be flexible in terms of the tasks they take on, and roles may change throughout the course of development as circumstances demand. 

#### Q8: How will you work as a team?

We will have two weekly meetings (both online) on Thursdays 7:30 to 9:00 pm and on Fridays 6:00 to 7:00 pm. Our Thursday meetings will cover what each of us would be doing for the following week and our Friday meetings will cover what each of us have done for the previous week. Coding sessions will happen anytime of the week where a small group of the team members will work together either in-person or online for a short amount of time.
  
#### Q9: How will you organize your team?

 - Meeting Minutes will be taken by ***fill*** and when they're not available, ***fill***
   - Meeting Minutes should contain name of all attendees and all actionable items from meetings
 - GitHub Issues will be used to track actionable items
 - Task organization and prioritization will be done in weekly meetings and will be displayed on GitHub Projects
 - Team members will have the freedom to "pick up" tasks in their area(s) of expertise
 - Tasks are complete when two other team members have reviewed them and they are merged to the `dev` branch

#### Q10: What are the rules regarding how your team works?
 We will use Discord as our main communication channel. We will have weekly meetings on Discord to discuss our progress and plan for the upcoming week. We do not have a partner for this project. 
 First in order to hold our group members accountable for the weekly meetings, we set our meeting times to have as little conflicts as possible for everyone. Also, we will use Github issues to give each member their own tasks to complete, which is their responsibility. All the tasks for the following week will be assigned during the Thursday weekly meetings.
 If one group member does not contribute or is not responsive, we will first try to contact them through Discord. If they still do not respond, we will contact them through email. If they still do not respond, we will contact the TA for help.

## Organisation Details

#### Q11. How does your team fit within the overall team organisation of the partner?
As our group does not have a partner, we will have to manage the entirety of the product development process ourselves. While we had considered searching for a similarly-focused partner to manage some of the processes involved, we are confident that the crucial divisions of the work involved—the development, testing, and maintenance of our software—can be managed effectively via internal processes in the group. The roles in our group have been comfortably divided into each member's strong suit, and as such each of us will have the most expertise in our field when it comes to the development and testing of the product. Moreover, as the technical elements required of our tasks and the background experience we have has a great deal of overlap; consequently, it will be no challenge for group members to work together to solve problems that cannot be done individually.
#### Q12. How does your project fit within the overall product from the partner?
Our project is the first step towards building this product, as we do not have a partner. Therefore, our product is a full-stack commitment which we will be managing on both frontend and backend. We will be responsible for building the core feature set ourselves, as well as a release pipeline. Although this compounds the responsibilities that our team will have to manage, this also allows us much more lateral freedom in the development of our product, and allows us to take full ownership of the work that we put out.

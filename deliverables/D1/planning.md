## Product Details
 
#### Q1: What is the product?

EduNexus is an educational application designed to automate and personalize the report generation process for schools in underprivileged and crisis-stricken regions.

The problem EduNexus addresses is the significant challenge that educational institutions in crisis-stricken areas face: the lack of infrastructure for creating and managing student report forms. These schools struggle with high student-teacher ratios and manual, error-prone processes that hinder the provision of individualized attention and feedback to students.

Our project is in collaboration with middle schools, focused on educational advancement in these regions. By partnering with them, we aim to ensure that the application meets the real-world needs of its users.

We are planning to build a responsive web-based application that enables educators to efficiently generate detailed and motivational student report forms. A typical use case might involve a teacher who needs to quickly produce end-of-term reports for a large class, where the application would facilitate the creation of these reports in a standardized format, complete with personalized comments and visual performance analytics.

EduNexus focuses on what it can deliver to its users: a streamlined administrative process, accurate and informative report forms, and a tool that supports educators in their mission to provide quality education, despite the challenging circumstances they face.

#### Q2: Who are your target users?

EduNexus is a web-based application tailored to assist teachers in underprivileged and crisis-impacted regions with automated and personalized student report generation.

The core problem that EduNexus solves is the overwhelming difficulty faced by educators in these areas, who often deal with inadequate resources for report creation and high student-teacher ratios. This situation leads to a lack of personalized educational feedback for students, which is crucial for their academic development.

In partnership with non-profit organizations that help these schools on a daily basis dedicated to educational equity, EduNexus will provide a solution specifically designed to meet the needs of these challenging educational environments.

We are building a responsive web application that will enable teachers, such as Ms. Kokoro Simba, a grade 5 educator at a rural middle school with limited access to technology, to efficiently create comprehensive and motivational report forms for her students. For instance, after a semester of teaching a class of 150 students, Ms. Simba will use EduNexus to quickly generate individualized reports that not only reflect each student's performance but also provide constructive feedback and visual analytics of their progress.

By focusing on the user experience of educators like Ms. Simba, EduNexus aims to deliver a product that simplifies the administrative workload, promotes educational insight, and supports the mission of providing quality education under challenging circumstances.

#### Q12. How does your project fit within the overall product from the partner?
* Look at the big picture of the product and think about how your project fits into this product.
* Is your project the first step towards building this product? Is it the first prototype? Are you developing the frontend of a product whose backend is developed by the partner? Are you building the release pipelines for a product that is developed by the partner? Are you building a core feature set and take full ownership of these features?
* You should also provide details of who else is contributing to what parts of the product, if you have this information. This is more important if the project that you will be working on has strong coupling with parts that will be contributed to by members other than your team (e.g. from partner).

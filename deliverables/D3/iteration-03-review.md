## Iteration 1 - Review & Retrospect

## Process - Reflection


#### Q1. What worked well

1. EsLint. EsLint forced the team to mantain good code quality. Although painful at first due to some line ending issues
and having to fix previously negleted code, enabling EsLint ensured that we were staying on top of our code style. This 
was further helped by us deciding to use pre-commit hooks that force EsLint. 
2. One effective approach that contributed positively to our software engineering project was the implementation of pair programming. This collaborative technique proved particularly beneficial when team members with specialized expertise in certain areas were able to mentor and assist others, thereby accelerating the overall programming process. A notable instance of this was when a team member encountered difficulties in comprehending specific aspects of our React code. Through pair programming, they gained a clearer understanding and were able to progress more efficiently. This method not only facilitated knowledge sharing but also enhanced the cohesiveness and productivity of our team.
3. Another successful strategy in our project was conducting group calls during the merging of our branches. This collaborative approach significantly expedited the merging process and reduced the likelihood of errors. Moreover, the responsiveness and willingness of all team members to assist one another were commendable, contributing to a smooth and efficient workflow. As a result, the development process in D3 was significantly smoother compared to D2


#### Q2. What did not work well

1. During the development of D2, we operated in separate sub-teams with limited communication. This led to discrepancies in expectations between the different groups, highlighting the importance of regular interaction and alignment among all team members.
2. An area for improvement in our team is to prioritize completing tasks well in advance of their deadlines. By doing so, we can reduce stress for all members and create a more comfortable working environment. Additionally, scheduling collaborative work sessions earlier in the timeline can help mitigate any scheduling conflicts that may arise among group members, ensuring a smoother and more efficient workflow.


#### Q3(a). Planned changes

 * A planned adjustment for our team is to increase the frequency of our in-person collaborative work sessions. While virtual sessions have proven valuable, we believe that face-to-face interactions will further enhance our ability to support each other and improve the overall efficiency of our workflow.

#### Q3(b). Integration & Next steps
Briefly explain how you integrated the previously developed individuals components as one product (i.e. How did you be combine the code from 3 sub-repos previously created) and if/how the assignment was helpful or not helpful.

 * We integrated code from various sub-branches, establishing a partially functional prototype, then we focus towards actively building upon the prototype.


## Product - Review

> NOTE: We are completing this deliverable without a partner and therefore did not perform a demo.

#### Q4. How was your product demo?
 * How did you prepare your demo?
 * What did you manage to demo to your partner?
 * Did your partner accept the features? And were there change requests?
 * What were your learnings through this process? This can be either from a process and/or product perspective.
 * *This section will be marked very leniently so keep it brief and just make sure the points are addressed*

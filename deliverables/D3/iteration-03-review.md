## Iteration 1 - Review & Retrospect

> NOTE: We are completing this deliverable without a partner and therefore did not have a partner meeting

 * When: N/A
 * Where: N/A

## Process - Reflection


#### Q1. What worked well

1. EsLint. EsLint forced the team to mantain good code quality. Although painful at first due to some line ending issues
and having to fix previously negleted code, enabling EsLint ensured that we were staying on top of our code style. This 
was further helped by us deciding to use pre-commit hooks that force EsLint.

3.

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions and actions that worked well.


 * 2 - 4 important decisions, processes, actions, or anything else that worked well for you, ordered from most to least important.

#### Q3(a). Planned changes

List any **process-related** (i.e. team organization and/or how you work) changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

 * Ordered from most to least important, with supporting argument explaining a change.

#### Q3(b). Integration & Next steps
Briefly explain how you integrated the previously developed individuals components as one product (i.e. How did you be combine the code from 3 sub-repos previously created) and if/how the assignment was helpful or not helpful.

 * Keep this very short (1-3 lines).


## Product - Review

#### Q4. How was your product demo?
 * How did you prepare your demo?
 * What did you manage to demo to your partner?
 * Did your partner accept the features? And were there change requests?
 * What were your learnings through this process? This can be either from a process and/or product perspective.
 * *This section will be marked very leniently so keep it brief and just make sure the points are addressed*

The application serves as a straightforward demonstration of integrating our `database.js` library with Electron. Everything is kept as simple as possible for demonstration purposes. You can play with the database using this application or built your own based on our library.

## How to install

**Currently only support windows**
1. Go to Release [D2-37.3] and download `database-win32-x64` than extract said file.

2. Open `database.exe` in the extracted folder
